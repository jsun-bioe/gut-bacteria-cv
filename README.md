Phenotypic characterization of human gut bacteria using computer vision-guided high-throughput imaging

## Introduction
Gut bacteria is a complex community with >300 species and they have profound impacts on our health. High-throughput imaging provides a rich source of information to understand the functional and physiological capabilities of each individual species. Here we present an automated computer vision-based pipeline that can segment single cells from phase-contrast images, track cell lineages and extract growth parameters in a high-throughput manner.

## Data
Time-lapse microscopy data is acquired for >90 representative strains among the gut commensal bacteria using a high-throughput imaging technique called SLIP (Strain Library Imaging Protocol), recently developed in the Huang lab.

## Pipeline
The pipeline includes algorithms for image segmentation, cell contour extraction and cell tracking. It uses a deep learning framework called DeepCell for single-cell image segmentation, which can be deployed on a computing server. Contour extraction, cell tracking and postprocessing is done in MATLAB with lightweight scripts or GUI.
